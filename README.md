# Bioinformatics scientist/PhD candidate

## Summary
I study alternative splicing in the _C. elegans_ genome by writing algorithms in Python to parse through genomic data. My goal is to develop a model of the noisy background of alternative splicing. Currently, I am looking for internship opportunites that will allow me to expand my skillset into NGS analysis.
